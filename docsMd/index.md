# `Rebel Retreat` Rules


### To access the rest of the server, Please read and follow all rules below, and react with the check mark, Ignorance of the rules is not a excuse from punishment
1. Be Kind. Treat others how you would want them to treat you or your family member. Be respectful of those in the server. It is much appreciated. 

2. Posts that are inflammatory or intended solely to offend or provoke will not be tolerated.

3. Racism, sexism, harassment, trolling/flaming or any other malicious posts/chat are not permitted. Defaming and derogatory chat toward any person or group of people will not be tolerated-even in joke or meme form. 
4. NSFW Chat, Memes, or pictures are not permitted—Only chat/posts that would be appropriate to use in front of a boss. This means keep the chat PG (other than in the PG-13 channels). If you don’t know if it is ok to post, then it is probably not. Please err on the side of caution. 
5. Inappropriate names and/or avatars, including controversial, provocative, or malicious material, are not allowed. Names must also include letters that are easily pingable by staff to help with server management if needed. 
6. Do not spam/flood in any way - Doing this in any of the text channels and/or voice channels is not tolerated.
7. You may not advertise other servers or services. Without permission or in the #channel
8. [Discord ToS](https://discordapp.com/terms) and [community guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines) must be followed at all times or you may be banned without notice.
9. Please utilize the correct channels for their given purpose. 
10. Please avoid pinging Admins, cops, or dev’s in the server. As much as they would love to respond, we can not deal with everything as quickly
11. If help is needed, you may find help by going to the #help channel and following the directions in that channel to create a ticket. When a ticket is created, it will ping an online mod to that ticket channel. This will allow us to help you in the privacy of your own support ticket. Do not ping staff members unless you need their help immediately. In emergent situations, you could ping for a mod that was seen online or if no mod was seen online then the chat mod role could be used as a last resort to get help emergently (for example a channel getting raided). Please utilize #help for most server questions/concerns/needs, and only ping in emergent situations. 
12. Respect all the members of the server—including the mods/staff. The staff/mods will attempt to be fair, unbiased and respectful. If you feel that a staff member was not, please notify a server manager. Please, when possible, have screenshot proof. 
13. Encouraging/Advocating for any of the above misbehaviors could also result in punishment. 14. The most important thing we can all do is have fun, but always be mindful that what you do doesn’t impair the experiences of anyone else in the community. 
15. Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse. Please be sure that you are always aware of the rules. When/If rules are updated, an announcement will be made. Moderators/Staff have final say in the enforcement of these guidelines or any punishments. Don't attempt to loophole or use semantics
to get around these rules. Respect the intent behind them, not the literal text. It would be impossible to cover every situation, but these guidelines will help direct.
